# Predicting School Drop-Out with Machine Learning
## Expanding the Existing Research to India

School dropout is a major problem in developing countries and it impairs their ability to create human capital. Using machine learning models schools could identify and target the students at risk of dropping out and enroll them in a support program while keeping the total cost as low as possible. Using data from the India Human Development Survey, we show that it is possible to reach 70% of the students at risk by enrolling in the program ~23% of the kids. If a model similar to the ones we propose would be widely adopted it would increase the cost-effectiveness of programs targeted at keeping kids in education allowing both to reduce the prevalence of dropout and use the available resources efficiently.

The code to clean the data, define, and train the models can be found in the analysis_clean.ipynb notebook. The data can be freely accessed from the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research at this link https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/DSDR/studies/37382. Data for individuals comes from the DS5 folder while data on households comes from the DS9 folder.
